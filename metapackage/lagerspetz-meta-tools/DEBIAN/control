Description: metapackage pulling in maven, java, texstudio, etc work tools.
 This package is meant to shorten the list of manually installed packages on Ubuntu/Mint systems, and to help replicate a configuration on a new machine.
 Pulls in work tools for programming and academic publishing, as well as drawing, design tools. Note: intel-microcode removed for now, investigating hibernate issue according to https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2321399&page=3A
 Removed thrift-compiler, since we now need Thrift 0.11.0 and there is no current package for it.
 Added sbt, since most of my scala projects use it. Added python3-seaborn for quick visualizations. Added mono-complete which seems to have been missing before.
 Removed atom, I no longer use it. Removed jabref, it depends on old JDK 8, which will not be supported in the future.
 Moved dbeaver-ce into recommends.
 Moved pdftk to suggests, it has been removed from Ubuntu 18.04.
 Removed qgis, I no longer use it.
 Removed openoffice-hyphenation and some ssh packages that should be there anyway.
